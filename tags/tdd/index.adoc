:title: TDD (Test-driven Development)

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development[Test-driven development] is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.
